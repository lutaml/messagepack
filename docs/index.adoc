nav_order: 1

== Purpose

MessagePack Ruby is a pure Ruby implementation of the https://msgpack.org/[MessagePack] binary serialization format. MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format that enables exchange of data among multiple languages like JSON, but is faster and smaller.

This implementation provides:

* Pure Ruby implementation (no C extension required)
* Full compatibility with the MessagePack specification
* Support for custom extension types
* Thread-safe factory pattern for packer/unpacker reuse
* Streaming unpacker for incremental parsing
* Comprehensive timestamp support with nanosecond precision

== Getting started

=== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'messagepack'
----

And then execute:

[source,shell]
----
bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,shell]
----
gem install messagepack
----

=== Quick start

[source,ruby]
----
require 'messagepack'

# Serialize data
data = { hello: "world", count: 42 }
binary = Messagepack.pack(data)

# Deserialize data
result = Messagepack.unpack(binary)
# => {"hello"=>"world", "count"=>42}
